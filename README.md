This program calculates and draws "quads" on images in varius input formats (for supported formats see [image crate](https://crates.io/crates/image)).

Everything is completely customizable, from rgba tresholds to subdivide the quads to how to draw the quads.

### Documentation
https://github.com/JacopoWolf/quadtree-over-media-rs/wiki

### Planned features
* further optimization
* take directly a video as input [improbable]
* shared image cache for batching
* separate into a CLI bin and a library
